# Meetway
This is my semester long project for my Network Based App Development class - a web appliation for local meetups.

This repository contains a NodeJS application that can be run locally or deployed to a server. This readme file will guide you through the installation process.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you can run the application, you will need the following installed on your system:
- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies required for the application.
4. Run the application using `npm start` or `nodemon app`. This will start the server and make the application accessible via `localhost:3000` (or whatever port number you have set).

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can use it by accessing it through a web browser or a REST client such as Postman.
